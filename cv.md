Brest customs, Brest, Belarus

In my current job, I have to constantly work in an application written using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have to work in this application for 12 hours a day. This application was written by people who are far from the main activity of the customs and from the areas of work where this program is used.This program often lacked functionality that could make my work easier. The technical staff is very slow to finalize this program. In order to make my work easier, I myself studied Javascript, HTML, CSS, added functions for myself in the current program window, which made my work easier. Then I found myself enjoying it, it's interesting. In my free time from work I study Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, java, in order to connect further work with this field of activity.
